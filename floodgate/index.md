# Floodgate
Floodgate is a hybrid mode plugin which allows for **Minecraft: Bedrock Accounts** to join **Minecraft: Java Edition** servers without needing a Minecraft: Java Edition account. This is something you install **in addition** to Geyser. Unlike Geyser, Floodgate can **only** be installed as a plugin on Bukkit, Bungeecord, and Velocity, and can only be utilized on servers that have it installed.
